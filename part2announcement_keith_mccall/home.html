		<h1 class="heading">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</h1>

		<p class="text">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is the fifth studio album by American rapper Kanye West, released on November 22, 2010, by Roc-A-Fella Records. Following a period of public and legal controversy, West retreated to a "self-imposed exile" in Hawaii in 2009. There, he worked on the album in a communal recording environment that involved numerous contributing musicians and producers. The album features guest appearances from Bon Iver, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, Nicki Minaj, John Legend and more.
		<br>
		<br>
		Production was led by West himself, alongside a variety of high-profile record producers including Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink and DJ Frank E. Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, opulent production quality, and dichotomous themes, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West's previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream.
		<br>
		<br>
		To promote the album, West released free songs through his GOOD Fridays series and four singles: the Billboard hits "Power", "Monster", and "Runaway", and the international hit "All of the Lights". It was also promoted with a short film set to the record's music, Runaway. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and eventually sold 1,032,000 copies in the United States. A widespread critical success, it was named the best album of 2010 by many publications and has since appeared on several lists ranking the greatest albums of all time.</p>

		<h3 class="heading">Dark Fantasy</h3>

		<p class="text">Preceded by the darkest period of Kanye’s life, which culminated in the infamous Taylor Swift incident, this conceptual albums digs deeper into the dark side of fame. This track mainly showcases the side of fame people first think of, but Nicki’s intro and the mourning hook indicate we’ll hear something different. Although a music video wasn’t released, it’s the first track featured in Kanye’s full-length film Runaway.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="commentary">"Even though the invite really was to check out clothes, I had told myself I was going to get on that album—whether he knew or not. [Laughs.] I’m not even a morning person and he wanted me to come at 9 a.m. I get there and I like his clothes. He’s like, “I knew you’d like this!” Then he started playing his album and I start humming and doing some little runs to what I’m hearing on the sly tip. I came in there humming! I knew what I was doing. [Laughs.] So he hears me and is like, “You can really sing. Yo, can you put some backgrounds on this song ‘Hell of a Life’?” He knew I was signed to Pharrell and all that, but I guess he didn’t know what I could really do. Like I said, we were more fashion friends. He just knew I was fly. So then he tells me to do “Dark Fantasy.” At the time it was pretty empty, just verses. He put me in another room by myself and said, “Go.” I came back with a whole intro and chorus. I did all the scratches and the cuts myself with my voice. That’s not a DJ thing when you hear my voice go like that. I was so nervous when I played it for Kanye. I hadn’t been in the studio for so long. I was so excited to be trying out for that song."

		<h6>ft. Kid Cudi &amp; Raekwon</h6>

		<p class="text">Kanye West’s “Gorgeous” from his 2010 critically acclaimed My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy contrasts beautiful production with lyrics describing the ugly nature of racial injustice in America, ironically (and patronizingly) calling the nation “gorgeous” because of it.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="commentary">“Gorgeous was one of those records that, as soon as I heard the beat, I was like, ‘Man, this is the one. This is that 'This Can’t Be Life' Kanye beat. This is that classic ‘[Kan]Ye beat. I want to be on this.’ I came up to him, and I was like, ‘Man, are you working on this record? Are you working on this beat?’ He goes, ‘Yeah … do you got an idea for it?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, I might. I didn’t. I was lying like a motherfucker. I was like, ‘Yeah, man, I want to get on this joint.”

		<h3 class="heading">Power</h3>

		<p class="text">Produced by Kanye and S1, “POWER” was released as the lead single of the album. It samples “21st Century Schizoid Man” by progressive British rock band King Crimson, the drums from the Cold Grits' rendition of “It’s Your Thing” (not the first time), and “Afroamerica” by Continent Number 6.
		<br>
		<br>
		During an interview with New York radio station Power 105.1, West said he spent thousands of hours working on this carefully-crafted song. “A song like ‘Power’ took 5,000 hours, like literally 5,000 man-hours to do this one record. That’s the amount of time I was putting into every song on the album,” West revealed.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="commentary">“I didn't write my raps down for my first four albums — like at all, I did it from the head straight to the booth. But on this last album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, I wrote it. I really put myself in the zone that my life was dependent on the success of this album. With that being the case, I said, ‘You know what? No matter what anybody says about me, they won’t — I can write something that can make someone that hates me the most have to really respect or love the song.’ So even a song like ‘Power,’ I spent 5,000 hours writing it, and it’s really the psychology behind the lyrics; it’s not just blatantly, ‘I’ve got all the power’ — ‘No one man should have all that power.’ It’s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone. Even if I use first person and say ‘I, I, I,’ it’s always for everyone."

		<h3 class="heading">All of the Lights</h3>

		<p class="text">“All of the Lights” is the 4th single from Kanye West’s 5th studio album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The song is about Kanye’s qualms living as a celebrity with personal problems in the public eye. He conveys this through the image of lights and the story of a troubled family – domestic abuse, imprisonment, separation/divorce etc. The song serves as a literal story of troubles in the home, and also as a metaphor for Kanye’s struggles with fame and his relation to hip-hop.
		<br>
		<br>
		Although the song has contributions from 14 other renowned artists (including Drake, Alicia Keys, John Legend, and more), they are listed as additional vocalists in the liner notes. Rihanna is solely credited as the featured artist on the single. After its release, Kanye said that he had worked for over 2 years on the song, working with many other artists because he just couldn’t find the one.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="commentary">"[Kanye] actually played his album to me, like, three months ago, and ‘All of the Lights,’ that was one of my favorite songs. So when he asked me to come up to the studio at 2 o'clock in the morning, I had to, because I loved it, I knew it was that song."

		<h6>ft. Jay-Z, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, &amp; Bon Iver</h6>

		<p class="text">"Monster" was released as the third single from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The track features Jay-Z, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, and singer Justin Vernon of indie folk group Bon Iver. All five credited performers have writing credits on the posse cut, with the production handled by West and Mike Dean. Lyrically, the song expresses often disturbing, horror film influenced concepts, with some comparing the track's eerie aesthetic to the Michael Jackson song "Thriller". The song contains an atmospheric, drum-heavy composition, notable for featuring no samples.
		<br>
		<br>
		Nicki Minaj’s verse has often been heralded as one of the greatest feature verses of the 2010s, playing around with her Roman accent, rhyme schemes, and lyrical concepts.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="commentary">"I was actually in the studio with Kanye in Hawaii when he played the concept for me. I was blown away. I had the opportunity to sit in the studio while Nicki wrote her verse just off the record. That was when she earned my respect as a lyricist. She was a dope entertainer up until that day that I sat in the studio and watched her come up with what I feel is one of the dopest verses of the year"

		<h6>ft. Swizz Beatz, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Cyhi the Prynce &amp; RZA</h6>

		<p class="text">"So Appalled" was first released on September 24, 2010, and was the seventh song to be featured on West's GOOD Fridays, a music giveaway that provided free MP3 downloads every week. It was originally believed to be a song for West and Jay-Z's collaborative album Watch the Throne, but it was later confirmed not to be. The song would later find its way onto My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy along with two other GOOD Friday songs. The version on the album was altered production-wise and was longer, and featured a sample of Manfred Mann Earth Band's song "You Are – I Am". The song was released with two covers, one with a famous photo of a model vomiting red nail polish, taken by Guy Bourdin; and the other containing the same image, with dimmed lighting and obscured by thick red letters. Before its release the song was leaked online and was nearly scrapped.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="commentary">"It was actually just ‘Ye on it. I had already raved over the record because it leaked. I was like listen, there is no way this can’t be on your album, you’d have to be crazy. He was like “Really, you think so?” I was like c’mon man we got to stop treating rap like oh it came out it’s dead. When it’s good, we have to make people love it and digest it."

		<h3 class="heading">Devil in a New Dress</h3>
		<h6>ft. Rick Ross</h6>

		<p class="text">Produced by Bink, “Devil In a New Dress” finds Kanye using familiar religious imagery in contemplating all intimate thoughts about his girl. It’s perhaps an ode to Amber Rose, Kanye’s (now ex-) girlfriend and recent muse. The song samples Smokey Robinson's quiet storm recording "Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow", and is themed lyrically to lust and heartache. Both the topics of love and religion serve as the main inspiration to the song.
		<br>
		<br>
		The title, of course, is a pun on the famous Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels song “Devil with a Blue Dress On”, as well as being a reference to the 1995 Denzel Washington and Don Cheadle film Devil in a Blue Dress.
		<br>
		<br>
		Fresh off of the success of his Teflon Don album, Miami rapper Rick Ro$$ spits what is often regarded as one of the finest verses of his career.
		<br>
		<br>
		Although the song has contributions from 14 other renowned artists (including Drake, Alicia Keys, John Legend, and more), they are listed as additional vocalists in the liner notes. Rihanna is solely credited as the featured artist on the single. After its release, Kanye said that he had worked for over 2 years on the song, working with many other artists because he just couldn’t find the one.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="commentary">"I got a call, they wanted me to be a part of that record. It was actually the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. So I just sat there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year."

		<h3 class="heading">Runaway</h3>
		<h6>ft. Pusha T</h6>

		<p class="text">Described as a deeply personal song in nature, it expresses West's thoughts on his failed relationships, and his acceptance of the media's perception of him. Lyrically the song explores criticism aimed at West in the past and serves as a "toast to the douchebags."
		<br>
		<br>
		Some of the inspiration of the song was derived from various media controversies, including West's interruption of recording artist Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards during her acceptance speech. The controversy caused West to exile himself in Oahu, Hawaii and record his fifth studio album mostly in a reclusive nature, shying away from collaborating with artists he wasn't personally close to.[7] Like the majority of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, "Runaway" was produced there. Amongst the various artists invited down to Hawaii to record songs for the album was Pusha T, a rapper known for the hip-hop duo Clipse.
		<br>
		<br>
		According to Pusha T, the song was recorded in either March or April 2010. Most of the recording crew on the project had forgotten and or forgiven West for the incident with Swift, including Pusha T, who described the event as "old news".[8] By the time Pusha T was supposed to record his verse for the song, West had already recorded a majority of the song. Pusha T had to record his verse several times, because West didn't think Pusha T was being mean enough for the concept of the song the first few times. Pusha T commented that re-doing a verse was something he very rarely did. Generally, Pusha T would write his verses very quickly, and noted that he made the exception for West who he had described as a perfectionist.[8] During the recording process, the two had collaborated on several songs together.
		<br>
		<br>
		The piano, the echoing voice in the background, the distortion on his singing, the vocoder solo: every single element of this track is spine-tingling, hauntingly beautiful. Combine that with Pusha’s verse and it becomes Greek tragedy rap: it takes the clichéd ideas of power, sex, money and removes all the glamour from them.
		<br>
		<br>
		West has stated that the song serves as “a toast to the douchebags.” West weaves a tale through topics such as his relationship with Amber Rose, his arrogance, and sorrow.
		<br>
		<br>
		While MBDTF was released a year after his VMA incident with Taylor Swift, West expressed that “Runaway” is not an apology.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="commentary">"We recorded quite a few songs. He had the record already and was like, 'Yo, I want you on this record.' A lot of stuff from him comes from conversation. He'll talk to you and get a feel for your perspective and your outlook on shit. And later, he'll be like, 'Yo, I want you on this. I got a record that that perspective would fit on.' That's how he operates. [...] You will find yourself explaining yourself, and if you can't explain the reasoning behind the things you're saying in a verse or whatever the case may be, it might not fly. He won't let you get away with it."

		<h3 class="heading">Hell of a Life</h3>
		

		<p class="text">"Hell of a Life" tells the story of marriage between West and a porn star. The porn star in question has been interpreted as an allusion to Amber Rose, a former stripper. Along with "Iron Man", the song samples "She's My Baby," by Sylvester Stewart, and performed by The Mojo Men; and of "Stud-Spider" by Tony Joe White. It is inspired by psychedelic rock, and features baroque braggadocio inspired rapping delivered by West. Aesthetically the production of the song draws from both stoner rock and progressive rock. It has been described as "feverish", "nightmarish", "grimy" and "grotesque" in nature. The primarily bombastic production is littered with heavy synths and brooding, abrasive riffs. The song expresses West's thoughts on relations and features highly sexual themes and imagery, sneering at people who judge him negatively. During the song's climax, West muses "how could you say, 'They live their life wrong?" before launching into the repeated refrain of "when you never fuck with the lights on?" The melodic, riff-ridden chorus is sung by West, boasting about how "pussy and religion is all I need."</p>

		<h6>ft. John Legend</h6>

		<p class="text">This entire song can be taken two different ways: One, Kanye is talking about his relationship with fame (pretty easy to see metaphor-wise). Two, he’s talking about a specific girl in his life.
		<br>
		<br>
		Also seems easy to see (almost too easy, which is why a lot of people believe it to only be about fame), but the last lines of the song before Chris Rock comes in tells us that ‘Ye could be talking about a real person, and Chris Rock is sketching a real conversation 'Ye heard on the phone (titled “The Best Birthday”).</p>

		According to Kanye, the verse began as a poem he emailed to Kim Kardashian because he had the beat but no lyrics. He made the revelation at his Glastonbury 2015 headline set.

		The song’s introduction and the chorus’s interpolation are from Bon Iver’s Woods from their EP Blood Bank. The chorus structure mimics Bon Iver’s song structure. While Bon Iver laments about the woods, West expands the scope of the song outside of the woods to the city and beyond to America as a whole.</p>

		<p class="commentary">"So I head out there and he plays me the track and it sounds exactly like how you want it to sound: forward moving, interesting, light-hearted, heavy-hearted, fucking incredible sounding jam. It was kind of bare so I added some choir-sounding stuff and then thicked out the samples with my voice. That whole first week I was there we worked on the 'Woods' song, which is called 'Lost in the World'. We were just eating breakfast and listening to the song on the speakers and he's like, 'Fuck, this is going to be the festival closer.' I was like, 'Yeah, cool.' It kind of freaked me out."

		<h6>ft. Gil Scott-Heron</h6>

		<p class="text">The final song of My Beautiful Twisted Dark Fantasy, “Who Will Survive in America” is an abridged version of Gil-Scott Heron’s “Comment #1” that paints a bleak outlook for Kanye’s future and summarizes the entire album: is all the decadence of fame and fortune worth it? What do we lose in the process? And does it really make a difference in the end? The song flows immediately from the end of the previous track “Lost In The World”.
		<br>
		<br>
		Kanye has always been a big proponent of Scott-Heron samples, whether on his own material (Late Registration’s “My Way Home” features an instantly recognizable bit from “Home Is Where the Hatred Is”) or on production for others (Common’s “The People” takes “We Almost Lost Detroit”).
		<br>
		<br>
		Scott-Heron (songwriter, performer, novelist, poet and the founding father of rap) passed away six months after the release of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy at the age of 62. Kanye performed both “Lost in the World” and “Who Will Survive in America” at his memorial service.</p>

		<p class="commentary">	Us living as we do upside-down<br>
								And the new word to have is revolution<br>
								People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel<br>
								Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued<br>
								And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey<br>
								The youngsters who were programmed<br>
								To continue fucking up woke up one night<br>
								Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys<br>
								America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes<br>
								The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina<br>
								We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal<br>
								Two long centuries buried in the musty vault<br>
								Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume<br>
								America was a bastard<br>
								The illegitimate daughter of the mother country<br>
								Whose legs were then spread around the world<br>
								And a rapist known as freedom, free-DOOM<br>
								Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names<br>
								That preceded, the bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin'<br>
								In the mother country's crotch<br>
								What does Webster say about soul?<br>
								"All I want is a good home and a wife<br>
								And a children, and some food to feed them every night"<br>
								After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you<br>
								WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?<br>
								WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?<br>
								WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?<br>
								WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
